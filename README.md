# Lenia-in-HAL
Repository for Lenia framework, implemented in Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) 


Lenia is a cellular automata framework developed [here](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) that offers capabilities for simulating continuous space and time, making it suitable for studying the collective behavior of interacting biological agents, such as individual cells or organisms. Cellular automata are valuable tools for studying the rules governing the behavior of complex systems, including multi-factorial diseases like cancer. This Repository is for the Lenia framework, implemented in Hybrid Automata Library [(HAL)](https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Overview

 Lenia-in-HAL is developed at the EDIT lab at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute. It provides various features essential for cancer modeling, including:

- Cellular replication
- Growth
- Motility
- Evolvability
- Adaptation

## Features

Lenia is designed to recapitulate various models commonly used in cancer research, including:

1. **Classical Analytical Models**: Lenia can simulate ordinary differential equations commonly used in cancer research.
2. **Stochastic Agent-Based Models**: It supports common stochastic agent-based models of cancer.
3. **Evolutionary Game Theory**: Lenia can model multiple cell types competing on Darwinian fitness landscapes.
4. **Cell Migration**: It includes generalized cell migration models like chemotaxis commonly used in cancer mathematical modeling literature.

## Usage

Lenia is easy to implement and supports single or multiple players. Users can define growth functions and various kernel sizes/functions for spatial interaction. More details on using Lenia in cancer modeling can be found in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.10.575036v2.abstract).
