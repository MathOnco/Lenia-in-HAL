  Lenia, a cellular automata framework used in artificial
  life, provides a natural setting to design, implement, and
  analyze mathematical models of cancer progression and
  treatment. Leniaâ€™s suitability as a cancer model is
  derived from the strong parallels between artificial life
  and cancer evolution: morphogenesis, homeostasis,
  motility, reproduction, growth, stimuli response,
  evolvability, and adaptation. Historically, agent-based
  models of cancer progression have been constructed with
  rules that govern birth, death, and migration based on the
  local availability of space, with attempts to map local
  rules to emergent global growth dynamics. In contrast,
  Lenia provides a flexible framework for considering a
  spectrum of local (cell-scale) to global (tumor-scale)
  dynamics by defining an interaction kernel governing
  density-dependent growth dynamics. Lenia can recapitulate
  a range of cancer model classifications including local or
  global, deterministic or stochastic, non-spatial or
  spatial, single or multi-population, and off or
  on-lattice. Lenia is subsequently used to develop
  data-informed models of 1) single-population growth
  dynamics, 2) multi-population cell-cell competition
  models, and 3) cell migration or chemotaxis.
